# zookeeper
hello , its an small program made using basic python conditionals and while loops.
Things to learn from this project

variables: I have created 5 variables for storing our animals
for making animals by simple raw text we need raw string functionality so for this part i have used    r ' our text ' 
this will make our text multiline and anything inside the r' ' will be considered as raw text.


1) here i have intilaized whileloop as infinite loop by setting it to True
2) a input from user(string type)
3) conditional part:
    when you are done by visting every animal of zoo ... you can simply type exit to get out of the loop and i have called a function exit().
    
    for out of range input value we will be printing a message with specific input range for our program:
    
    last part(that's the main part though):
    here we are indexing the animal dictionary by the user input value (but wait! on step 2 we have declared input for string and not for integer?)
    so for that purpose we will be typecasting our string input to integer by animal[int(user_input)].
    
I hope this info will be clear and helful for understanding the basics :)
